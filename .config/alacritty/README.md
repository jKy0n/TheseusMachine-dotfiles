### Basically uses:

- Catppuccin Macchiato theme (My favorite theme)
- zsh by default (Shell I am most accustomed to)
- xterm-256color (for better visual effect)
- Meslo font (both for powerlevel10k and my favorite font)
- 20% Transparency (0.8)
- Dynamic title (for better integration with awesomeWM)
- Beam cursor with blinking enabled (better for writing for me)
- Animation and sound for notifications. (good for alerts)
- And some keybinds (I need to review some, especially Vi mode)

### Why Alacritty:

My choice for Alacritty is based on four key aspects:

1. GPU acceleration
2. Simplicity
3. Configurability
4. Consolidation

I am aware of other similar terminals like Kitty and Foot, but Alacritty ultimately meets all my requirements.
